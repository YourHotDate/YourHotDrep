    "comment": "I am voting \"No\" based on the potential for volatile and unstable funding years.\n\nI believe the net change limit should be based relatively on the prior year treasury income. Meaning since there is a fixed supply of total lovelace, a high level of accumulation in the treasury relative to the total supply of lovelace is not necessary.  I also believe that solely basing the net change limit on prior year treasury income will create years where net change is very high and other years where net change is very low relatively. \n\nThere should be a ratio of treasury inflows to net change limit that will pave the path for a higher or lower net change limit than prior year, or some sort of system that should be maintained to not have volatile years of funding. Moving in the direction of flat or gently rising net change limits will be beneficial to the predictability and consistency of funding projects and innovation.\n\nAn approach such as having a starting net change limit of 100 million to 200 million ADA and every year and using the information from prior year treasury inflows compared to the amount of ADA from the prior year budget to vote on increasing or decreasing the new net change limit by up to 10%. Then having a ratio safe guard that says, if the net change limit is less than 1/12 of the total budget then we can override the 10% rule and vote on up to 25% increase or greater than 1/4 of the total budget then we can override the 10% rule and vote on up to 25% decrease. Under these conditions we will have a much more stable looking and feeling fund for innovation."
