    "comment": "Taking into consideration that the Treasury tax has been unchanged for years, i believe going from 20% to %10 is a good starting point. I believe as governance actions become more frequent the treasury tax will change will be less drastic. As we understand how much money we spend and how much we want to spend becomes apparent not just through theory but through on-chain history, i believe the future will likely consist of changing the tax by a couple of percent. With all things considered i believe the change from 20% to 10% is reasonable until future events reveal that an adjustment is needed. "
